# MIT 6.824 Distributed System
I have been following this MIT classes [6.824](http://nil.lcs.mit.edu/6.824/2020/schedule.html) for more than one year, watching the uploaded [live class video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQP8WApzIQQ&list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB), reading the suggested papers and doing the coding assignments. I pushed my coding assignments in this repository.
The coding assignment consists of four parts and I will push the code from time to time. Here is the current status:
### Coding progress
 - [x] [LAB-1] MapReduce
 - [x] [LAB-2A] Leader election and heartbeat
 - [x] [LAB-2B] Log appends
 - [x] [LAB-2C] Raft state persistence
 - [ ] [LAB-3] Log compaction
 - [ ] [LAB-4] Sharded key/value service
